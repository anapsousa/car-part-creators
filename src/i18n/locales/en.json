        "question": "Is Dr3amToReal a new business?",
        "answer": "Yes. Dr3amToReal is a young brand, currently growing under PompousWeek Unipessoal Lda, a Portuguese company.\n\nWhile the 3D-printing studio is new, it builds on years of experience in engineering, testing, and quality-focused work."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Do you only sell what's in the shop?",
        "answer": "Not always.\n\nSome designs are available as ready-to-order prints, but custom requests and personalisation are a big part of what I do.\n\nIf you have:\n• a part that's hard to find\n• an idea you want to bring to life\n• or an object you'd like adapted\n\nYou can contact me to discuss feasibility."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can you design a custom part for me?",
        "answer": "Yes — depending on complexity, purpose, and timeframe.\n\nCustom design work may include:\n• measurements or reference photos\n• iteration and testing\n• material selection guidance\n\nNot every request will be a fit, but I'm always happy to explore possibilities."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do you sell digital files (STL)?",
        "answer": "At the moment, Dr3amToReal focuses primarily on printed objects.\n\nDigital files may be offered in the future for selected designs, but the priority right now is delivering tested, physical results."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What materials do you use?",
        "answer": "Material choice depends on the object's purpose.\n\nThis can include:\n• durable functional plastics\n• materials suitable for decorative or indoor use\n• finishes chosen for strength, feel, or aesthetics\n\nIf you're ordering a custom piece, material options will be discussed with you."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Are these mass-produced items?",
        "answer": "No.\n\nMost pieces are:\n• made to order\n• produced in small batches\n• or created as one-offs\n\nThis allows for better quality control and personalisation."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Where are you based? Do you ship internationally?",
        "answer": "Dr3amToReal is based in Portugal.\n\nInternational shipping may be available depending on the product and destination.\n\nDetails are confirmed at order time."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "I have an idea but don't know if it's possible. What should I do?",
        "answer": "That's perfectly fine — many projects start that way.\n\nYou can get in touch with:\n• a description of the idea\n• photos, sketches, or references (if available)\n• what you want the object to do\n\nWe'll take it from there."
