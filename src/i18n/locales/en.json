      "q1": {
        "question": "How does the AI 3D model generator work?",
        "answer": "Our AI analyses your text description and generates a detailed 3D model based on your specifications. Simply describe what you want to create, select the category, and our advanced AI will handle the rest."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What file formats do you support?",
        "answer": "We provide models in both STL and BLEND formats. STL files are perfect for 3D printing, whilst BLEND files can be further edited in Blender."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I edit the generated models?",
        "answer": "Yes! BLEND files can be opened and modified in Blender, a free 3D modelling software. STL files can be edited using various 3D editing tools."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does generation take?",
        "answer": "Most models are generated within 2-5 minutes, depending on complexity. You'll receive a notification once your model is ready to download."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the result?",
        "answer": "You can regenerate models with different descriptions at no extra cost. We're committed to helping you achieve the perfect result."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Do you offer commercial licences?",
