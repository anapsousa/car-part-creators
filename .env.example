# Supabase Credentials Guide
#
# IMPORTANT: Understand the difference between keys:
# - The **anon/public key** is used for client-side authentication in your frontend application.
#   It is safe to expose in frontend code as it has limited permissions and is designed for public use.
# - The **database password** is used for direct database connections (e.g., server-side or admin tools).
#   It should NEVER be included in frontend code or `.env` files, as it grants full database access.
#
# WARNING: The database password is NOT needed for this frontend application and should never be added to `.env`.
#
# Step-by-step instructions to obtain credentials:
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
# 2. Copy the 'Project URL' for VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# 3. Copy the 'anon public' key for VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# 4. Copy the 'Project Reference ID' for VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
#
# This is a template file for environment variables.
# Copy this file to `.env` for remote Supabase or `.env.local` for local Supabase.
# Get production credentials from the Supabase project dashboard.
# Get local credentials by running `supabase status` after `supabase start`.
# Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files to version control.

# The Supabase project URL (production or local)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"

# The Supabase anon/public key
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-public-key-here"

# The Supabase project ID
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Local development section (uncomment and update for local Supabase)
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL="http://localhost:54321"
# VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<get-from-supabase-status>"
# VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="<local-project-id>"

# ⚠️  ADMIN ONLY - Service Role Key for running migrations/scripts
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role (secret key)
# NEVER commit this to git or expose publicly!
# Use for: npm run migrate:db
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-secret-key-here
# This key bypasses RLS and has full DB access. Only use for migrations. Remove after use.
